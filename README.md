An android application demo targetted at Nepali SIM subscribers to provide them an easy way to take data packs.
Works for Namaste and Ncell currently. Uses AccessibilityService to parse the USSD response and cancel the USSD
response dialog automatically. Expect AccessibilityService related bugs in Xaomi, Redmi, Oppo and other devices. Works fine in Samsung.
